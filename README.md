# SPIS-Machine-Learning-Project
SPIS 2022 ML Project - A Housing Price Predictor

Hello everyone -- This is a project I made in the span of a week during UCSD's SPIS 2022. I spent around 4-6 hours a day for the past week working on it,
with a 10 hour session on the last day to debug last-minute critical errors to bring it home. I hope you enjoy, and as there's always room for improvement,
I may push more changes in the future!

One thing to note about the code is that there are two separate components to it -- One that I made that consisted of the Linear and Autoregression and another that
my partner Rushil made. You may also notice that some areas are commented out, and that is for future revision, as the incompatibility of both the programs
we wrote made us resort to having two separate programs. In my defense, I did not want to resort to using so much NumPy and Pandas without so much knowledge,
so I read a bit more on the documentation and how to correctly format training data for processing and prediction!

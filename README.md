# SPIS-Machine-Learning-Project
SPIS 2022 ML Project - A Housing Price Predictor

Hello everyone -- This is a project I made in the span of a week during UCSD's SPIS 2022. I spent around 4-6 hours a day for the past week working on it,
with a 10 hour session on the last day to debug last-minute critical errors to bring it home. I hope you enjoy, and as there's always room for improvement,
I may push more changes in the future!
